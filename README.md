# Trade-system
## Purposes
I have always liked the idea of making money from market fluctuations, so I became interested in trading quite some time ago. Of course, eventually I came to the conclusion that I wanted to automate my ideas. As a result, I created several algorithms that allow me to achieve some desired goals, specifically related to stock trading. This repository consists of several algorithms. I would like to pay attention to a robot that trades a spread of two currencies and backtesting algorithms of several of my developments with genetic parametrization.
